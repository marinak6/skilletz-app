project-102-skilletz created by GitHub Classroom

Skilletz is a peer-to-peer social connection site meant to bring the larger UVA community together. Finding peers is too hard, and it really shouldn't be. We should be able to find peers based on major, classes, or experience, without any trouble. We hope to make the spread of information easier and to help all students learn in the environment that suits them best.

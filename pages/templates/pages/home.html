<div>
	<p>
		This is where the actual HTML for the page goes. The line at the top of the file
		says that this HTML should be injected into the base.html file for each "block".
		This let's us put all of the code that belongs on every page (navbar, logo, etc)
		in one place (base.html) and keep the details like the contents of the page in 
		these files.

				<p>
					Who hasn't needed to find study partners and groups throughout the college grind? Whether
					you are looking for group mates for semester long projects, want help from students that
					have already taken a class, or just need to cram for that exam coming up, we have you
					covered. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We at Skilletz think that finding peers is too hard, and it really shouldn't be. We should
					be able to find peers based on major, classes, taken, experience, without any trouble. 
					We hope to make the spread of information easier and to help all students learn in the 
					environment that suits them best.
